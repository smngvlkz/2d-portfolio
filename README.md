# Building a portfolio as a 2D Game

This a 2D game where you can play to view all the work I have done.

Its a tutorial from freeCodeCamp, taught by @JSLegendDev.
it caught my attention as I always wanted to build something like this. It was a nice way to strengthen my Javascript and HTML skills, and learn new ones.

## What I learned

I worked with vite, kaboom and Tilemap to build a 2D game portfolio. Vite is a build tool that offered faster development experience. Kaboom is a lightweight game programming library for JavaScript that made coding the game easy and fun. Tilemap allowed me to build the game world by tiling images/sprites instead of drawing everything individually.

## NOTE
This was a tutorial, not my actual work and I deployed it soley for anyone to also play along with it. Its not fully optimised for mobile. This is something I will need to do on my own. A great side project
