# Building a portfolio as a 2D Game

This a 2D game where you can play to view all the work you have done.

Its a tutorial from freeCodeCamp, taught by @JSLegendDev and it caught my attention as I always wanted to build something like this. It's a nice way to strengthen my Javascript, CSS and HTML skills, and learn new ones.

## What I learned

I am working with vite, kaboom and Tilemap to build a 2D game portfolio. Vite is a build tool that offers faster development experience. Kaboom is a lightweight game programming library for JavaScript that makes coding games easy and fun. Tilemap allows me to build the game world by tiling images/sprites instead of drawing everything individually.

## Using Tilemap

I also learned how to work with Tilemap by using it to build a 2D game. I used the same technique to build this portfolio.
